# `<form action="https://httpbin.org/get" method="get">`

 * `<form>` :
 * * The `<form>` element in HTML is used to create an interactive form on a web page. It allows users to input data, which can be submitted to a server for processing.
 * * Forms can contain various types of input elements such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, buttons, and more.
 * * When the form is submitted, the data entered by the user is sent to the server specified in the action attribute.

 * `action="https://httpbin.org/get"` :
 * * The action attribute of the `<form>` element specifies the URL where the form data should be submitted when the form is submitted.
 * * In this case, the form data will be submitted to the URL https://httpbin.org/get. This URL represents a service provided by httpbin.org that allows you to inspect HTTP requests and view the data that was sent.

 * `method="get"` :
 * * The `method` attribute of the `<form>` element specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data to the server.
 * * When the `method` is set to `"get"`, the form data is appended to the URL as a query string when the form is submitted.
 * * The `"get"` method is commonly used for forms that retrieve data from the server without modifying it. It is suitable for search forms and other types of data retrieval.

## How the form works..?

 * When the user fills out the form fields and submits the form, the data is sent to the URL specified in the `action` attribute (https://httpbin.org/get).
 * Since the `method` attribute is set to `"get"`, the form data is appended to the URL as a query string.
 * The server at https://httpbin.org/get receives the request and can process the data sent by the form.

# `<fieldset>`

 * The `<fieldset>` element in HTML is used to group related form elements within a web form. It helps to semantically organize and structure the form by visually grouping related fields together.
 * The `<fieldset>` element is used to logically group related form elements together, such as checkboxes, radio buttons, text fields, and more.
 * It's commonly used to group form fields that are related to a specific category, topic, or section of the form.
 * By default, browsers usually render `<fieldset>` elements with a border around the grouped fields and display the `<legend>` as a bold title above the fields.
 * It's important to note that the visual appearance of `<fieldset>` elements can be customized using CSS to match the design of the web page.

# `<legend>`

 * The `<legend>` element in HTML is used specifically within a `<fieldset>` element to provide a caption or description for the group of form fields enclosed within the `<fieldset>`.
 * The main purpose of the `<legend>` element is to provide a title, label, or descriptive text for the grouping of form fields within the `<fieldset>` element.
It helps users understand the context or purpose of the group of form fields within the fieldset.
 * The `<legend>` element enhances the accessibility of forms, especially for users with disabilities or using assistive technologies like screen readers.
 * Screen readers can announce the content of the `<legend>` element to users, providing context and guidance about the form fields grouped within the fieldset.
 * Browsers usually render the `<legend>` element as bold text, distinguishing it from the rest of the content within the `<fieldset>`.
 * The visual appearance of the `<legend>` element can be further customized using CSS to match the design of the webpage.

# `<label for="firstName">First Name : </label>`

 * `<label>` :
 * * The `<label>` element in HTML is used to define a label for an input element, such as an `<input>` field, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, etc.
 * * It provides a descriptive label or text that describes the purpose of the associated input field.

 * `for` :
 * * The `for` attribute of the `<label>` element specifies which input field the label is associated with.
 * * The value of the `for` attribute should match the `id` attribute of the input field it is labeling.

 * `firstName` & `id` :
 * * In example, the `for` attribute has a value of `"firstName"`, which corresponds to the `id` attribute of the input field it is associated with.
 * * For example, if you have an input field like `<input type="text" id="firstName" name="firstName">`, the `id` attribute of the input field is `"firstName"`, and it matches the for attribute of the label.

 * By using the `<label>` element with the `for` attribute, you provide a more accessible and user-friendly experience for users interacting with your forms, especially for those using assistive technologies or navigating through the form using keyboard shortcuts.

# `<input type="text" name="firstName" id="firstName" placeholder="Krunal" autocomplete="on" required autofocus>`

 * `<input>` :
 * * The `<input>` element in HTML is a versatile element used to create various types of form controls for gathering user input. It can generate different types of form controls based on the `type` attribute you specify.
 * * Apart from the `type` attribute, the `<input>` element can have various other attributes like `name`, `id`, `value`, `placeholder`, `readonly`, `disabled`, `required`, etc., depending on the type of input control and its purpose.
 * * The `<input>` element is self-closing, meaning it does not require a closing tag (`</input>`). You can specify its attributes directly within the opening tag.

 * `type="text"` :
 * * This attribute specifies the type of input element, which in this case is a text input field. Text input fields allow users to enter alphanumeric characters.
 * * ## Common `type` Values :
    * **Text Input :** 
    * * `<input type="text">` - Used for single-line text input fields.
    * **Password Input :** 
    * * `<input type="password">` - Similar to text input, but characters are masked for security.
    * * When a user enters characters into a password input field, the characters are displayed as asterisks (*) or dots (â€¢) instead of the actual characters.
    * **Telephone Number Input :** 
    * * `<input type="tel">` - indicates that the input field is intended for telephone numbers.
    * * Using `type="tel"` helps mobile devices optimize the keyboard layout for entering phone numbers.
    * **Checkbox :** 
    * * `<input type="checkbox">` - Used for checkboxes, allowing users to select multiple options.
    * **Radio Button :** 
    * * `<input type="radio">` - Used for radio buttons, allowing users to select a single option from a group.
    * **Submit Button :** 
    * * `<input type="submit">` - Used to submit the form data to the server.
    * **Reset Button :** 
    * * `<input type="reset">` - Resets the form fields to their initial values.
    * **File Input :** 
    * * `<input type="file">` - Allows users to upload files from their local device.
    * **Hidden Input :** 
    * * `<input type="hidden">` - Hides the input control from the user interface but can still be used to pass data when submitting forms.
    * * The primary purpose of the type="hidden" attribute is to include data that should be submitted with the form but is not intended to be visible or editable by the user.
    * * Hidden input fields are often used to pass information between pages or to include additional data along with the form submission.

 * `name="firstName"` :
 * * The `name` attribute defines the name of the input field. When the form is submitted, the data entered into this field is sent to the server with the name "firstName".

 * `id="firstName"` :
 * * The id attribute uniquely identifies the input field within the document. It is used for associating the input field with labels and for targeting the element with JavaScript or CSS.

 * `placeholder="Krunal"` : 
 * * The `placeholder` attribute provides a hint or example text that is displayed in the input field before the user enters any data. In this case, "Krunal" is displayed as a placeholder text in the input field.

 * `autocomplete="on"` : 
 * * This attribute enables browser-based autocompletion for the input field. When set to "on", the browser may suggest previously entered values for similar input fields based on the user's browsing history or stored form data.

 * `required` : 
 * * The `required` attribute is a boolean attribute that indicates that the input field must be filled out before submitting the form. If the field is empty when the form is submitted, the browser will display an error message prompting the user to fill in the required field.

 * `autofocus` : 
 * * The `autofocus` attribute automatically focuses the input field when the page loads, allowing users to start typing without having to manually click on the input field.

## `pattern="[0-9]{3}[0-9]{3}[0-9]{4}`

 * The `pattern` attribute defines a regular expression pattern that the entered value must match for the input to be considered valid.
 * In this example, `[0-9]{3}[0-9]{3}[0-9]{4}` represents the pattern for a 10-digit phone number, where each digit is a number from 0 to 9.

 * `[0-9]` : Matches any digit from 0 to 9.
 * `{3}` : Specifies that the preceding pattern `[0-9]` must appear exactly 3 times.
 * `[0-9]{3}` : Matches three consecutive digits.
 * `[0-9]{4}` : Matches four consecutive digits.

 * Putting it all together, the pattern `[0-9]{3}[0-9]{3}[0-9]{4}` ensures that the input value consists of 10 digits arranged in the format of a typical US phone number (e.g., 1234567890).

 *  the `pattern` attribute allows you to enforce specific formatting rules for user input, ensuring that the entered data conforms to a predefined pattern before the form is submitted. In this case, the pattern ensures that users enter a valid 10-digit phone number. If the input doesn't match the specified pattern, the browser will prevent form submission and may display an error message prompting the user to correct the input.


# `<input type="number" name="decade" id="decade" min="1950" max="2020" step="10" value="1980">`

 * `min="1950"` :
 * * The `min` attribute specifies the minimum value that the input field can accept. In this case, the minimum value allowed is 1950.

 * `max="2020"` :
 * * The `max` attribute specifies the maximum value that the input field can accept. In this case, the maximum value allowed is 2020.

 * `step="10"` :
 * * The `step` attribute specifies the increment or decrement by which the value can be changed when using the arrow buttons or keyboard controls. In this case, the value changes by increments of 10.

 * `value="1980"` :
 * * The `value` attribute sets the initial value of the input field. In this case, the initial value is set to 1980.

 * This type of input field is commonly used when specific numeric values or ranges need to be entered, such as years, ages, or quantities.

# `<select name="coffee" id="coffee" multiple size="5">`

 * The `<select>` element provided creates a dropdown menu or list box in an HTML form.

 * `name="coffee"` :
 * * The `name` attribute assigns the name "coffee" to the select element. When the form containing this select element is submitted, the data selected within this field will be sent to the server with the name "coffee".

 * `id="coffee"` :
 * * The `id` attribute provides a unique identifier for the select element. It is often used to associate the select element with labels or for scripting purposes.

 * `multiple` :
 * * The `multiple` attribute allows users to select multiple options from the dropdown menu. If this attribute is present, users can select multiple options by holding down the Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac) key while clicking on the options.

 * `size="5"` :
 * * The `size` attribute determines the number of options that are visible at once in the dropdown menu without scrolling. In this case, the dropdown menu will display five options at a time.


# `<optgroup label="Coffees">`

 * The `<optgroup>` element in HTML is used to group related `<option>` elements within a `<select>` dropdown menu.

 * `label="Coffees"` :
 * * The `label` attribute specifies the label or title of the `<optgroup>`. In this case, "Coffees" will be displayed as the heading for the group of options within the dropdown menu.


# `<option value="latte" selected>`

 * The `<option>` element in HTML is used to define an option within a `<select>` dropdown menu.

 * `value="latte"` :
 * * The `value` attribute specifies the value associated with the option. When the user selects this option from the dropdown menu, the value "latte" will be sent to the server if the form containing this dropdown menu is submitted.

 * `selected` :
 * * The `selected` attribute is a boolean attribute that, when present, specifies that the option should be preselected by default when the dropdown menu is rendered.

 * The `<option>` element is used to provide users with a list of choices within a dropdown menu, and each `<option>` element defines one of the available choices. Users can select one of these options from the menu to submit with the form data.

# `<input list="coffee-list">` `<datalist id="coffee-list">`

 * The `list="coffee-list"` attribute in the `<input>` tag is used to associate the input field with a `<datalist>` element, providing users with a predefined list of options to choose from or to suggest options based on user input.

 * `<datalist id="coffee-list">` :
 * * This creates a datalist element with the ID `"coffee-list"`.
 * * The datalist element contains a list of predefined options that will be suggested to the user as they type into the associated input field.
 * * Each option in the datalist is defined using `<option>` elements within the `<datalist>` element.


# `<textarea name="message" id="message" cols="30" rows="10" placeholder="Type your message here"></textarea>`

 * The `<textarea>` element is used to create a multi-line text input field in HTML forms.

 * `cols="30"` :
 * * The `cols` attribute specifies the visible width of the textarea, measured in average character widths. In this case, the textarea will display enough space for approximately 30 characters in each row.

 * `rows="10"` :
 * * The `rows` attribute specifies the visible height of the textarea, measured in rows of text. In this case, the textarea will display enough space for 10 rows of text.


# `<button type="submit">Submit</button>`

 * This button serves as the default submission button for the form.
 * When clicked, it submits the form data to the URL specified in the form's `action` attribute using the HTTP method specified in the form's `method` attribute (typically `GET` or `POST`).
 * The `type="submit"` attribute explicitly defines this button as a submit button, which triggers the form submission behavior.
 * The button label is "Submit", indicating to users that clicking it will submit the form.


# `<button type="submit" formaction="https://httpbin.org/post" formmethod="post">Post</button>`

 * This button overrides the default form submission behavior for the form it belongs to.
 * The `type="submit"` attribute defines this button as a submit button.
 * The `formaction` attribute specifies the URL where the form data should be submitted when this button is clicked. In this case, it submits the form data to "https://httpbin.org/post".
 * The `formmethod` attribute specifies the HTTP method (e.g., `GET` or `POST`) to be used when submitting the form data. Here, it's set to POST.
 * The button label is "Post", indicating to users that clicking it will submit the form using the `POST` method to a specific URL.


# `<button type="reset">Reset</button>`

 * This button resets the form's controls to their initial values.
 * When clicked, it clears any user-entered data in the form fields and restores the form to its original state.
 * The `type="reset"` attribute explicitly defines this button as a reset button.
 * The button label is "Reset", indicating to users that clicking it will clear the form fields.



# `GET` & `POST`

 * `GET` :
 * * Requests data from a specified resource.
 * * Data is sent in the URL as part of the query string.
 * * Limited amount of data can be sent (URL length restrictions).
 * * Parameters are visible in the URL, which can impact security if sensitive data is transmitted.
 * * Cached by browsers, so data may be stored in browser history.
 * * Generally used for retrieving data from the server, such as fetching web pages or data from a database.

 * `POST` :
 * * Submits data to be processed to a specified resource.
 * * Data is sent in the request body.
 * * No restrictions on the amount of data that can be sent.
 * * Parameters are not visible in the URL, which provides better security for sensitive data.
 * * Not cached by browsers, so data is not stored in browser history.
 * * Generally used for submitting form data, uploading files, or making changes to the server's state.

 * GET is used for requests where data is being retrieved from the server, while POST is used for requests where data is being sent to the server to be processed or stored. The choice between GET and POST depends on the specific requirements of the application and the type of data being transmitted.
