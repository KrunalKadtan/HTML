## Block-Level Elements

 * Block-level elements are HTML elements that typically start on a new line and occupy the full width available to them by default. They create "blocks" of content in the document's layout.
 * Examples :
 * * `<div>`
 * * `<p>`
 * * `<h1>` to `<h6>`
 * * `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`
 * * `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`
 * * `<form>`, `<table>`, `<blockquote>`
 * * `<hr>`, `<pre>`, `<main>`

 * They can contain other block-level elements and inline elements.
 * They can have margins, padding, width, and height properties applied to them.

## Inline Elemets

 * Inline elements, as the name suggests, do not start on a new line and only occupy as much width as necessary. They flow with the surrounding text.
 * Examples :
 * * `<span>`
 * * `<a>`
 * * `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<b>`, `<i>`
 * * `<img>`, `<br>`, `<input>`, `<abbr>`
 * * `<cite>`, `<code>`, `<q>`, `<sub>`, `<sup>`

 * They flow within the content, allowing other inline elements to sit beside them horizontally.
 * They cannot contain block-level elements but can contain other inline elements.
 * Inline elements are often used for styling parts of text, creating links, or inserting images within text.

## HTML Entities

 * HTML documents are typically encoded using character sets like **UTF-8** or **ISO-8859-1**, which support a wide range of characters from various languages and scripts.
 * However, some characters have special meaning in HTML, such as `<`, `>`, `"`, and `&`. Using these characters directly in HTML can lead to parsing errors or unintended rendering.

 * HTML entities provide a way to represent these special characters using a specific syntax.
 * An entity is denoted by an ampersand (`&`) followed by a symbolic name or a numeric code representing the character, and ending with a semicolon (`;`).

 * There are two main types of HTML entities: named entities and numeric entities.
 * Named entities use a symbolic name to represent a character, while numeric entities use the Unicode code point or ASCII value of the character.

 * Some common HTML entities include:
 * * `&lt;` for `<` (less than sign)
 * * `&gt;` for `>` (greater than sign)
 * * `&quot;` for `"` (quotation mark)
 * * `&amp;` for `&` (ampersand)
 * * `&nbsp;` for non-breaking space
 * * `&copy;` for `©` (copyright symbol)
 * * `&reg;` for `®` (registered trademark symbol)
 * * `&euro;` for `€` (euro symbol)

## `<h1>`

 * The `<h1>Hello World..!</h1>` element is an HTML tag used to create a level 1 heading in an HTML document.
 * `<h1>` represents the highest level of heading, indicating the most important heading on the page.
 * It is typically used for the main heading or title of a document or section.

## `<hr>`

 * By default, the `<hr>` element creates a horizontal line that extends across the entire width of its containing element, usually the width of the browser window or the width of the content area.
 * The appearance of the horizontal line can be customized using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to adjust attributes such as color, width, height, and style (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.).
 * `<hr>` is a self-closing tag and does not require a closing tag.

## `<h2>`

 * This is an HTML heading level 2 element.
 * It's used to represent a subsection heading, usually with less importance than the main heading (`<h1>`).
 * The text within `<h2>` tags is typically displayed in a larger, bold font compared to regular text.

## `<abbr>`

 * This is an abbreviation element used to define an abbreviation or acronym.
 * It's typically used to provide an expanded form or explanation of an abbreviation.

 * `title="HyperText Markup Language"` :
 * * This is the title attribute of the `<abbr>` element, which provides the full meaning or explanation of the abbreviation "HTML".
 * * When the user hovers over the abbreviation, the title attribute text is displayed as a tooltip.

 * `HTML` :
 * * This is the abbreviation itself, which will be displayed in the content.

## `<p>`

 * This is a paragraph element in HTML.
 * It's used to define a paragraph of text.

## `<h3>`

 * This is an HTML heading level 3 element.
 * It's used to represent a subsection heading, typically with less importance than `<h1>` and `<h2>` headings.
 * The text within `<h3>` tags is usually displayed in a slightly larger and bold font compared to regular text.

## `<br>`

 * This is a line break element in HTML.
 * It's used to break the content onto a new line within the paragraph.
 * It's a self-closing tag, which means it does not require a closing tag.
 * When the browser encounters `<br>`, it moves the following content to a new line.

## `&nbsp;`

 * This is a non-breaking space entity in HTML.
 * It's used to create space between words or elements that prevents browsers from collapsing multiple consecutive spaces into a single space.
 * Unlike regular space characters, which may be ignored or collapsed by the browser, `&nbsp;` ensures that spaces are preserved and displayed exactly as entered in the HTML code.

## `<em>`

 * `<em>` is an HTML tag used to emphasize text.
 * It stands for "emphasis".
 * When text is wrapped within `<em>` tags, it is typically displayed in italicized font by default in most browsers.
 * It's important to note that the use of `<em>` is semantic; it indicates emphasis rather than specifying the exact styling.

## `<address>`

 * `<address>` is an HTML tag used to define contact information for the author or owner of a document or article.
 * It's typically used to provide information such as a physical address, email address, or contact details.
 * The content within `<address>` tags is typically displayed in italicized font by default in most browsers.
 * It's important to note that the `<address>` tag does not provide any special styling; its purpose is semantic.

## `<!-- ... -->`

 * `<!--` and `-->` are HTML comment tags used to insert comments within the HTML code.
 * Anything placed between `<!--` and `-->` is considered a comment and is ignored by the browser when rendering the webpage.
 * Comments are not displayed on the webpage but are useful for adding notes or explanations within the HTML code for developers or collaborators.
