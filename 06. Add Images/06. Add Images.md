## `<img src="../Images/photo_2024.jpg" alt="Photo Generated By AI" title="I am learning HTML5" width="250" height="250" loading="lazy">`

 * `<img>` :
 * * This is the image element in HTML, used to embed images into a webpage.

 * `src="../Images/photo_2024.jpg"` :
 * *  This is an attribute of the `<img>` element. The `src` attribute specifies the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or the file path of the image to be displayed.
 * * In this case, the value of the `src` attribute is "../Images/photo_2024.jpg", which represents the relative path to the image file "photo_2024.jpg" located in the "Images" folder one level up from the current directory.

 * `alt="Photo Generated By AI"` :
 * * This is an attribute of the `<img>` element. The `alt` attribute provides alternative text for the image, which is displayed in case the image cannot be loaded or viewed by the user.
 * * It also provides accessibility benefits for users with screen readers or in situations where images are disabled.

 * `title="I am learning HTML5"` :
 * * This is an attribute of the `<img>` element. The `title` attribute specifies the title or tooltip text that appears when the user hovers over the image with their mouse cursor. In this case, the title text is "I am learning HTML5".

 * `width="250" height="250"` :
 * * These are attributes of the `<img>` element. The `width` & `height` attributes specify the width and height dimensions of the image in pixels.
 * * In this case, the image will be displayed with a width of 250 pixels and a height of 250 pixels.

 * `loading="lazy"` :
 * * The attribute `loading="lazy"` is an HTML attribute that can be applied to `<img>` (image) and `<iframe>` elements.
 * * It is used to defer the loading of offscreen images and iframes until the user scrolls near them.
 * * This attribute helps improve web page performance by prioritizing the loading of visible content while delaying the loading of content that is not immediately visible to the user.


## `<figure>`

 * The `<figure>` element is a semantic HTML5 element that is used to encapsulate and represent content that is referenced from the main content but is still considered a standalone piece.
 * It is often used to group and provide structure to content like images, illustrations, diagrams, code snippets, etc.
 * The `<figure>` element can contain different types of content, and it helps browsers and assistive technologies understand the relationship between the content and its caption.


## `<figcaption>`

 * The `<figcaption>` element is used to provide a caption or description for the content enclosed within the `<figure>` element.
 * It is placed inside the `<figure>` element and directly follows the content it is captioning.
 * The content within the `<figcaption>` element is typically text that describes or explains the content in the `<figure>`.
 * It's important to note that the `<figcaption>` element is optional, and a `<figure>` element can exist without it. However, when used, it enhances the accessibility and semantics of the content.


## `<code>`

 * The `<code>` element in HTML is used to define a fragment of computer code within the text of a document. 
 * It is typically used to display programming code, command-line input, or other snippets of text.
 * The content within the `<code>` element is typically displayed in a monospace font (such as Courier) by most browsers. This helps distinguish code from regular text and ensures that the code maintains its original formatting, including spaces and line breaks.
