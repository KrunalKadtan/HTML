The `<table>` element in HTML is used to create a structured grid or tabular data within a webpage. It allows you to organize information into rows and columns, making it easier for users to understand and compare data.

## Basic Structure

 * The `<table>` element serves as the container for the entire table.
 * Inside the `<table>` element, you typically include one or more `<tr>` elements, which represent table rows.


 ## Table Rows (`<tr>`)

 * Each `<tr>` element defines a row in the table.
 * Inside each `<tr>` element, you include one or more table cells (`<td>` or `<th>` elements) to represent the data within that row.

 ## Table Cells (`<td>` & `<th>`)

 * The `<td>` element represents a standard data cell in the table.
 * The `<th>` element represents a header cell in the table. Header cells are typically used to label rows or columns and are displayed in bold by default.
 * `<td>` and `<th>` elements must be placed within a `<tr>` element.

The `<table>` element can also include various attributes to control the appearance and behavior of the table, such as `border`, `width`, `cellpadding`, `cellspacing`, etc. However, it's recommended to use CSS for styling instead of these attributes.
